In the game of Boggle, a four-by-four grid of letters is provided from which players must form words from paths. A path starts anywhere on the grid and continues by moving horizontally, vertically, or diagonally one square at a time. Paths can change direction after each move. Squares cannot be repeated in a path. A path is a word only if it appears in a list of words. Upper and lowercase is irrelevant. 

Your program should accept a Boggle grid and print out a list of all the words that can be found in the grid. For a words list, use a *nix words file, this file, or another similar list of English words.

Don't worry about parsing a grid; your program can just accept grids already in whatever representation you would like.
 
 Here's an example grid: 
 E E C A
 A L E P
 H N B O
 Q T T Y
 one word in this grid is "toecap".
