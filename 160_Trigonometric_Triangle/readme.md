A triangle on a flat plane is described by its angles and side lengths, and you don't need to be given all of the angles and side lengths to work out the rest. In this challenge, you'll be working with right-angled triangles only.
Here's a representation of how this challenge will describe a triangle. Each side-length is a lower-case letter, and the angle opposite each side is an upper-case letter. For the purposes of this challenge, the angle C will always be the right-angle. Your challenge is, using basic trigonometry and given an appropriate number of values for the angles or side lengths, to find the rest of the values.
